/**
 * SequenceFileInputFormat, when given a path to a directory containing a mapfile "data" and
 * "index", should correctly pick out data, and process it, just as it would with sequence files.
 * However, it isn't. In particular, it is also other files like index or splits, and naturally
 * chokes. As a workaround, we provide this PathFilter, which explicitly excludes index files.
 * Future releases of hadoop may not need this workaround.
